## Analysis of MTA data

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), a fictitious organization, wishes to spread word of their annual gala (on May 30th 2017) by placing street teams in front of various New York MTA stations. The goal of the gala is to increase the participation of women in technology and extend their outreach. The street teams intend to interact with the crowd and get them to sign up for the gala.
